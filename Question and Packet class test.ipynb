Adams published a version of that story which incorporated the laryngeal theory of this language's phonology. That text in this language was first composed by linguist August (*)</b> Schleicher. Another story in this language was composed by Eric P. Hamp in an attempt to reconstruct the \"ancestor\" to a short passage from ancient Indian scriptures. Despite the fact that this language's speakers, whose homeland is the subject of the Kurgan hypothesis, did not have a writing system, linguists have reconstructed it through the use of the comparative method. For 10 points, identify this language spoken between 3,000 and 6,000 years ago whose daughter languages are now spoken across Europe and India.\n",
